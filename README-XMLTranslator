CWXMLTranslator
===============

CWXMLTranslator is a utility class for translating a XML document into live 
objects. This is useful for well defined and non-recursive XML documents,
for example RSS-feeds, status responses, etc.

How to perform the translation is defined in a translation DSL language, that is
parsed by the CWXMLTranslation class. The compiled internal format is complex 
and bound to change, so always use the DSL.


Translation DSL Syntax
==================

A human readable text-format should instead be used, by loading text files
using the standard xml translation file extension: .xmltranslation.

XML Translation format in Backus-Naur Form:
	translation ::= statement |							# A translation is one or more statement
					"{" statement* "}"
	statement 	::= { "." } SYMBOL action { ";" }		# A statement is an XML symbol with an action (prefix . is attributes).
	action 		::= "->" translation |					# -> Is a required tag to descend into, but take no action on.
					assignment target { ":" type }		# All other actions are assignment to a target, with optional type (NSString is used for untyped actions)
	assignment 	::= ">>" |								# Assign to target using setValue:forKey:
					"+>"								# Append to target using addValue:forKey:
	target 		::= "@root" |							# Target is the array of root objects to return.
					SYMBOL								# Target is a named property accessable using setValue:forKey:
	type 		::= SYMBOL								# Type is a known Objective-C class (NSNumber, NSDate, NSURL)
					SYMBOL translation |				# Type is an Objective-C class with  inline translation definition
				"@" SYMBOL								# Type is an Objective-C class with translation defiition in external class

Exmaple for translation this XML;
 	<Node>
		<Id>12</Id>
		<Url>http://www.foo.com"</Url>
		<Type name="bar" date="2010-10-28"/>
	</Node>
To fit these Objective-C classes:
	@interface CWNodeType : NSObject {
	}
	@property(copy) NSString* name;
	@property(retain) NSDate* date;
	@end
	@interface CWNode : NSObject {
	}
	@property(assign) NSInteger nodeID;
	@property(copy) NSURL* url;
	@property(retain) CWNodeType* type;
	@end

Use this translation definition
	Node +> @root : CWNode {			# Node tag shoudl be added as root object of class CWNode
		Id >> nodeID : NSNumber;		# Set Id tag content to nodeID property typed as a NSNumber
		Url >> url : NSURL;				# Set Url tag content to url property typed as a NSURL
		Type >> type : CWNodeType {		# Type tag sets a the type property to a new instance of CWNodeType class
			.name >> name;				# Set name attribute content to name property as a string
			.date >> date : NSDate; 	# Set date attribute content to date property typed as a NSDate
		}
	}

Like this:
    NSArray* objects = [CWXMLTranslator translateContentsOfURL:urlToXML
                                          withTranslationNamed:@"NameOfTranslationFile"
                                                      delegate:nil
                                                         error:NULL];
    CWNode* node = [objects lastObject];
